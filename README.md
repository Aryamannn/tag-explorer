# **Tag Explorer**

`Traditional hierarchical file systems can be limiting and inefficient for organizing and finding data. For example, deciding whether a file about a new AI-based approach to economics belongs in the "economics" or "AI" folder can be confusing, and deep folder hierarchies can complicate navigation. Tag Explorer solves these issues by utilizing a tag-based system for more flexible and efficient data organization. The goal is to simplify file organization and retrieval through tagging.
